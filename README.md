Hackathon 2022

# tdi

The command-line interface, for some, is the natural way to work on a computer.  The "To Do" app is the standard, simple interface to a simple problem.  Microsoft has a wonderful desktop/GUI application for doing such things - https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks/.  **tdi** (short for To Do Interface) intends to create a CLI app and interface to Microsoft Graph, the store for Microsoft To Do's managed tasks.  The app will be built in and released through Github - hoping for Windows, macOS and Linux builds.

## Development

There is an "official" application registration in Azure for the client.  But if you're wanting to use your own for development you can follow these steps:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/healthcare-apis/register-application

You will need both the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.  In addition you'll need to add the appropriate API permissions for `user.read` and `tasks.readwrite` in order for the application to access the Graph API.  With the credentials in hand you will then add them into the source code before building - here: https://github.com/microsofthackathons/tdi/blob/develop/src/tasks.rs#L17
